# ðŸ“˜ Course Description

**STRAT 490R â€“ Building Strategic AI Solutions** is a hands-on course where youâ€™ll learn to design, build, and deploy AI-powered capabilities that create strategic value. You will develop a practical understanding of modern large language models (LLMs) and explore how organizations can use them responsibly and effectively.

Over the semester, you will:

âœ… Build intuition about how LLMs work  
âœ… Practice prompt engineering and programmatic prompting  
âœ… Implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)  
âœ… Explore fine-tuning techniques  
âœ… Develop agent workflows for multi-step reasoning  
âœ… Prototype user interfaces to showcase your solutions  
âœ… 

The course culminates in a **final group project**, where youâ€™ll propose, prototype, and demo an AI-powered solution addressing a real organizational opportunity.
